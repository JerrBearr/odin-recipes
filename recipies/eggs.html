        <h3>OVerview: what to expect</h3>
        <p>This recipie can be a little hard if you are not patient. The potatos must be cooked throughly before adding the eggs, or certain herbs, or something will 
            go wrong(burned eggs, uncooked potatos, herb flavor missing, etc.). When cooking everything, you should only need one spatula, and one pan to combine everything.
            Start by heating a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat for about 4-5 minutes. Once butter sizzles <strong>ALL OVER THE PAN</strong> then it is time to add
            about a quarter stick of butter. Yes, you need a lot, and will be adding more. Once the butter is metled, add spices (not herbs) such as salt, pepper, chili powder, and
            garlic powder(even if using fresh garlic). If you want carmelized onions, add the garlic and onion now, if not, wait until 10 minutes after adding the potatos to your
            butter spice mixture. Put a lid over the potatos and turn down to medium heat. Scramble eggs, add all dry spices, and lastly, add herbs. Scramble until very fluffy.
            Check on potatos, and stir them every few mintues. When potatos are able to be cut into with light pressure from your spatula, they are done and the eggs should be added. 
            This usually takes about 15-20 minutes. Before adding the egg mixture, add another 1/8-1/4 stick of butter. This ensures the eggs wont stick to anything but your potatos.
            Turn Heat to high. Place ripped up spinach on top of eggs, and mix throughly into the pan, once eggs are satisfactory, enjoy! </p>

        <p>If you follow the above directions, you wont have to waste countless eggs and potatos like I have! Feel free to add your own extras as well, i usually chop up some peppers
            to go in with my onions!</p>

                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>Butter</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>List of Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Chop potatos into 1 inch cubes, mince or dice garlic and onions</li>
                <li>Tear up spinach into large pieces</li>
                <li>Preheat large cast iron skillet on medium-high</li>
                <li>Add butter onto skillet, add dry spices </li>
                <li>Add potatos. Allow them to soak up the spices and spread over them evenly. I usually add more dry spices here. If you like carmelized onions, now is the 
                    time to add them. Place lid on pan, turn down to medium heat</li>
                <li>Scramble eggs while waiting, add herbs and spices once scrambled</li>
                <li>Check on potatos every few minutes to make sure they arent sticking to the pan. If its a problem, add more butter</li>
                <li>Once potatos can be cut through with the spatula easily, they are ready for the eggs</li>
                <li>Add eggs mixture, then throw spinach in there while the eggs are still liquid and start mixing</li>
                <li>Once you are happy with how the eggs are cooked, turn off heat, and take off teh burner. Continue mixing for an additonal minute to avoid burning.</li>
            </ol>
