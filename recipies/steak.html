        <h3>Overview: What to expect</h3>
        <p>Making a marinade is easy! All you've gotta do, is combine a fat, with an acid, and add flavor! It may take you longer to assemble the ingredients, 
            than to actually make the marinade.</p>
        <p>First you need to know which type of steak you want to cook. If using a tougher cut of meat, like a tri tip, then you'll need to let it sit for longer 
            to pentrate and do its magic. If using something like a filet, or a New York, then 24-48 hours is plenty of time for marination. I will leave a tri 
        tip in the fridge marinating for close a week! Just make sure it is fully submerged, and in a sealed bag. If the bag inflates at all, your meat has gone bad!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>White balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Fresh pineapple, mango, and passionfruit if you have access</li>
            <li>Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>Salt, Pepper, Garlic powder</li>
            <li>Diced onions and garlic</li>
            <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>            
        </ul>
        <h3>How to make</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop onions and garilc</li>
            <li>Add to blender</li>
            <li>Add all liquid ingredients</li>
            <li>Blend all ingredients and spices</li>
            <li>Add chopped fruit, blend until even consistnecy</li>
            <p>NOTE: Do not add too much fruit. You just want a litte flavor, and especially with passionfruit, a little goes a long way.</p>
            <p>PS: If you pan fry your steak, you can use a little red wine and reduce it and make a sauce to pour over your steak. That is what I did in the above picture.</p>
